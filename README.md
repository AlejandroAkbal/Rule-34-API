# Rule 34 PWA Original API

## What is this?

It's a JSON API that you can use to access posts from various danbooru forums like rule34.xxx or rule34.paheal.net

> This API is going to be used on the [Rule 34 app](https://r34.app/).

### Goals
It is being developed with the following goals:
- Being as fast as possible
- Being as secure as it can be
- Wasting as little data as its needed
- Supporting various danbooru sites

For the initial version it has to have the same functionality as the currently used in [Rule 34 app](https://r34.app/).

The current API being used is from [Kurozenzen](https://github.com/kurozenzen/r34-json-api).
